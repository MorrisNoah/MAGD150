## My Processing Work in MAGD 150

This is a collection of my Processing sketches from the Intro to Media Arts and Game Development class.


### Lab 7 - Bee Game

```markdown
I had a lot of fun making this sketch.
This simply assignment turned in to a game.
It took a while to figure some things out,
like how to make the angled pedels follow the mouse,
but it was rewarding to acheive a finished product.
