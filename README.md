## My Processing Work in MAGD 150

This is a collection of my Processing sketches from the Intro to Media Arts and Game Development class.


### Lab 7 - Bee Game

```markdown
I had a lot of fun making this sketch. This simple assignment turned in to a game.
It took a while to figure some things out, like how to make the angled pedels follow the mouse,
but it was rewarding to acheive a finished product.

### Lab 9 - Man in the Mirror

```markdown
Another enjoyable assignment. The theme was mirrors, and I thought if implementing
Michael Jackson's song as a joke. The user interaction was fun to figure out how to work.

### Lab 10 - Working in 3D with Mario Box

```markdown
A Mario box that breaks, revealing a mushroom. This was a project created with a partner. 
He made the texture, and we both figured out how to get my animated shape to have the texture.
3D is interesting to work with, though I think processing is a limiting, requiring to much 
guesswork as I cycled between running and viewing the sketch.

### Lab 6 - "Z" Screensaver

```markdown
An animated screensaver of clouds with the letter "Z" on them. The clouds are made of a few
shaking ellipses, and they spawn at random locations.

```

### Lab 3 - Bubble wand

```markdown
A simple sketch from when I was first learning about interaction. The mouse if holding a bubble wand,
and if the user clicks and drags a bubble will form.
